# RAG Architecture Overview

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines the power of large language models 
with external knowledge retrieval. This approach addresses key limitations of 
standalone LLMs.

## Key Components

1. Document Store: Holds your knowledge base
2. Embedding Model: Converts text to vectors
3. Vector Database: Enables similarity search
4. LLM: Generates final response

## Benefits

- Reduces hallucinations by grounding responses in real documents
- Enables access to private or up-to-date information
- Provides citations and source attribution
- More cost-effective than fine-tuning
